//Chapter 3.2 Ownable Contracts
//We've gone ahead and copied the code of the Ownable contract into a new file, ownable.sol. Let's go ahead and make ZombieFactory inherit from it.

//Modify our code to import the contents of ownable.sol. If you don't remember how to do this take a look at zombiefeeding.sol.

//Modify the ZombieFactory contract to inherit from Ownable. Again, you can take a look at zombiefeeding.sol if you don't remember how this is done.

//Chapter 3.4 Struct Packing:
//In this lesson, we're going to add 2 new features to our zombies: level and readyTime â€” the latter will be used to implement a cooldown timer to limit how often a zombie can feed.

//So let's jump back to zombiefactory.sol.

//Add two more properties to our Zombie struct: level (a uint32), and readyTime (also a uint32). We want to pack these data types together, so let's put them at the end of the struct.
//32 bits is more than enough to hold the zombie's level and timestamp, so this will save us some gas costs by packing the data more tightly than using a regular uint (256-bits).
