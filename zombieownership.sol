/*Chapter 5.1:
We're going to dive into the ERC721 implementation in the next chapter. 
But first, let's set up our file structure for this lesson.
We're going to store all the ERC721 logic in a contract called ZombieOwnership.
Declare our pragma version at the top of the file (check previous lessons' files for the syntax).
This file should import from zombieattack.sol.
Declare a new contract, ZombieOwnership, that inherits from ZombieAttack. Leave the body of the contract empty for now.

Chapter 5.2:
We've already created erc721.sol with the interface above for you.
Import erc721.sol into zombieownership.sol
Declare that ZombieOwnership inherits from ZombieAttack AND ERC721

Chapter 5.3:
I'll leave it to you to figure out how to implement these 2 functions.
Each function should simply be 1 line of code, a return statement. 
Take a look at our code from previous lessons to see where we're storing this data. 
If you can't figure it out, you can hit the "show me the answer" button for some help.
Implement balanceOf to return the number of zombies _owner has.
Implement ownerOf to return the address of whoever owns the zombie with ID _tokenId.

Chapter 5.5:
Let's define the logic for _transfer.

Define a function named _transfer. It will take 3 arguments, address _from, address _to, and uint256 _tokenId. 
It should be a private function.

We have 2 mappings that will change when ownership changes: ownerZombieCount 
(which keeps track of how many zombies an owner has) and zombieToOwner (which keeps track of who owns what).

The first thing our function should do is increment ownerZombieCount for the person receiving the zombie (address _to). 
Use ++ to increment.

Next, we'll need to decrease the ownerZombieCount for the person sending the zombie (address _from). Use -- to decrement.

Lastly, we'll want to change zombieToOwner mapping for this _tokenId so it now points to _to.

I lied, that wasn't the last step. There's one more thing we should do.

The ERC721 spec includes a Transfer event. The last line of this function should fire Transfer with the correct information 
â€” check erc721.sol to see what arguments it's expecting to be called with and implement it here.

contract ERC721 {
  event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
  event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);

  function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);
  function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
  function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
  function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
