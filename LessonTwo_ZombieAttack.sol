//Chapter 2: Mapping and Addresses
//To store zombie ownership, we're going to use two mappings: one that keeps track of the address that owns a zombie, 
//and another that keeps track of how many zombies an owner has.
//Create a mapping called zombieToOwner. The key will be a uint (we'll store and look up the zombie based on its id) 
//and the value an address. Let's make this mapping public.
//Create a mapping called ownerZombieCount, where the key is an address and the value a uint.
